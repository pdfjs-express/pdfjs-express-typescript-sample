# TypeScript PDF Viewer Sample (PDF.js Express)

[PDF.js Express](https://pdfjs.express/) is a powerful JavaScript-based PDF Library that leverages PDF.js and adds additional features such as annotations, form support, and digitial signatures. It provides a slick out-of-the-box responsive UI that interacts with the core library to view, annotate and manipulate PDFs that can be embedded into any web project.

This repo is specifically designed for any users interested in integrating WebViewer into a TypeScript project. Express has a comprehensive definition file ready for use by just adding a reference to the definition file.
